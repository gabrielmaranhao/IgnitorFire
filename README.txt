This project features an embedded system capable of remotely triggering fireworks from the smartphone to
a distance of more than 500 masters (already tested).

Two systems were created, a Receptor responsible for receive the radio messages, and select the right channel to execute the fire action. A Transmitter for receive the messages from the smartphone, and send it to the receptor.

Firmware developed in C for PIC microcontrollers with XC8 compiler.
PCB hardware created on the EasyEDA platform and manufactured in its own environment in China.
Handmade welding and assembly.
